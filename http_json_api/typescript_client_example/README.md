# Autogenerated client example for TypeScript
This is an autogenerated example of how to use the http rest api client
in TypeScript. The client code in "nav_client" is all autogenerated using
the OpenAPI spec (see package.json for the command used to generate it).

There are adaptors for many languages that can generate clients for any
OpenAPI spec (which you can access at http://localhost:3000/openapi.json)
on the computer that is running SonaSoft.
