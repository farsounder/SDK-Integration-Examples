# Licensing
The SonaSoft SDK is provided free of charge for non-commercial applications, 
development partners are still required to sign a licensing agreement with
FarSounder to receive the complete SDK materials (the SonaSoft demo software)
and eventually to become an authorized third-party integrator. Please contact
us at service@farsounder.com to complete the licensing agreement or discuss use 
for commercial applications.
