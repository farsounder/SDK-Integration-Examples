# Minimal SDK Example
## Example implementation - SonaSoftâ„¢ SDK message passing
This example implements both methods of commumicating with SonaSoft via the API described in [FarSounder's SDK documentation:](http://www.farsounder.com/files/F33583-FarSounder_IDD_4.0.1.pdf)

The compiled versions of the `proto-files` are already included in the project, however if needed they can be compiled using the included version of the protoc.exe proto compiler and the .bat file in `SDKMessageExample/SDKMessageExample/build_protos.bat`. The necessary binaries for ZeroMQ are also included. However if you would like to download either of these dependencies, they can be found here:
* ZeroMQ - https://zeromq.org/
* ProtocolBuffers - https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers

We use ProtocolBuffers to manage structured data in a language neutral way, and ZeroMQ to pass serialized "proto" messages between processes.

If you have any questions, suggestions, or recommendations, please feel free to email: service@farsounder.com.

## Running the example
This version of the example uses C++ in Visual Studio 2019 on Windows. The
required versions of the zeromq and protobuf libraries are included in the
project.
First, you will need to compile the .proto files into cpp files. This can be
done by running the build_protos.bat file in the SDKMessageExample folder.
Next, add the PATH=$(Path);$(SolutionDir)\SDKMessageExample\libzmq; to solution
properties -> debugging --> environment and make sure merge environment is
true. This is to find the zmq dll at runtime.
